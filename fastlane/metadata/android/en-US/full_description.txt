DroidFS is an alternative way to use encrypted overlay file-systems on Android that uses its own internal file explorer instead of mounting virtual volumes. This allows you to store files in encrypted virtual volumes that other apps can't decrypt.
Currently, DroidFS supports only <b>gocryptfs</b>. This algorithm protects file contents and file names but doesn't hide directory structure or file sizes. If you want more details, take a look at their GitHub repository: https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs

<b>Features:</b>
- Volumes fully compatibles with their original algorithm implementation
- Internal opening of images, videos, audios and text files
- Common file and folder operations: copy, move, rename, delete
- Volume password changing
- Internal and shared storage support
- Cross-volume imports
- Internal camera to take encrypted pictures or videos
- Theme color fully customizable

<b>Permissions:</b>
<b>Read & write access to shared storage:</b> required to create, open and modify volumes and import/export files to/from volumes.
<b>Biometric/Fingerprint hardware:</b> needed to encrypt/decrypt password hashes using a fingerprint protected key.
<b>Camera:</b> required to take encrypted photos or videos directly from DroidFS. You can deny this permission if you don't want to use this feature.
<b>Record audio:</b> required if you want sound on videos recorded with DroidFS.

DroidFS is free, open-source, and you can find the project's repository:
- on GitHub: https://github.com/hardcore-sushi/DroidFS
- on the Gitea instance of the Chapril project: https://forge.chapril.org/hardcoresushi/DroidFS

<b>Warning !</b>
Security is relative. DroidFS does not come with any warranty and should not be considered as an absolute safe way to store files.
